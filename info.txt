Tyson Fury (born 12 August 1988) is a British professional boxer. He is a two-time world heavyweight champion, having held the WBC and The Ring magazine titles since defeating Deontay Wilder in 2020; previously he held the unified WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO and The Ring titles after defeating Wladimir Klitschko in 2015. With his defeat of Wilder, Fury became the third heavyweight, after Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali, to hold The Ring magazine title twice, and is widely considered by media outlets to be the lineal heavyweight champion.[3][4][5][6] As of November 2021, Fury is ranked as the world's best active heavyweight by ESPN,[7] the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB)[8] and BoxRec,[9]. He is ranked as the third-best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec,[10] fourth by ESPN[11] and seventh by the TBRB[12] and the Boxing Writers Association of America.[13]

As an amateur, Fury represented both England and Ireland, as he was born in Manchester to an Irish Traveller family. Fury's family lineage comes from Belfast and Galway; his parents emigrated to England at a young age.[14] He won the ABA super-heavyweight title in 2008 before turning professional later that year at 20 years of age. After winning the English heavyweight title twice, he became the British and Commonwealth champion in 2011 by defeating the 14–0 Derek Chisora. He then won the Irish and WBO Inter-Continental titles, before defeating Chisora again in a 2014 rematch for the European and WBO International heavyweight titles. This success, along with his 24–0 record, set up a match with the long-reigning world champion Wladimir Klitschko in Germany, which Fury won by unanimous decision.
